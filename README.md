# Deblur

# **Introduction**

This project presents a convolutional neural network (CNN) model for image deblurring. The blur type is generated by randomly translating and overlaying slightly shifted original images. This type of blur simulates hand shake during long exposure photography.

#**Dataset and Preprocessing**

The project uses the MNIST dataset, with images preprocessed as follows:

Normalized between 0 and 1
Split into train (80%) and validation (20%)
Blurred images generated with random shift (using generator function)

#**Model**

The model is a CNN with:

ResNet blocks to handle vanishing gradients
ReLU activation for computational efficiency
Batch normalization for stability and speed
MSE loss function
Adam optimizer with learning rate 0.0002 and beta_1 0.5

#**Training**

The model was trained for 99 epochs on batches of 64 images.

#**Evaluation**

The evaluation was conducted on 10000 blurred images from the validation set, repeating the experiment 10 times and calculating:

Mean Squared Error (MSE)
MSE Standard Deviation

#**Results**

Mean MSE: 0.0012
MSE Standard Deviation: 0.0001

#**Visualization**

Some images are displayed to show the deblurring effect.
